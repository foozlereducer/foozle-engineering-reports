The ACTO Reports framework uses AVA as a test runner and has superTest and Sinon. 
All plugins should make use of this test library, like:

You create your tests in acto-product-engineering-reports/tests/

You should create a director named after your plugin and put your plugin tests within it; 
this will keep your plugin tests grouped together.

## Writing your first test ##
import test from 'ava';
// import your service
import (MyService) from './some/location

test('clear message as to what the test should show', async t => {
    const ms = new MyService();
    t.true(ms instanceof MyService);
});
